The dungeon actor generate a procedural layout for your dungeon based on the various configuration paramters.  
After the layout has been generated, it spawns meshes, lights, blueprints etc, based on the mappings you have defined in the Theme file.   This way you can define what meshes needs to be attached to the floors, walls, ceilings, etc
