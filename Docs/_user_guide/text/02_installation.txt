Installation
============
* In your game's root directory, create a folder named Plugins
* Copy the DungeonArchitect folder found in this archive under Plugin/4.X/ into your game's plugin folder (which was created in step 1).  For example, in the ShooterGame sample demo, the directory structure should look like this:
![Install Step 1](_html/images/user_guide/install_step1.png)
* Restart the Unreal Editor (if already open) and verify that Dungeon Architect is enabled by navigating to Window Menu > Plugins.  ![Install Step 2](_html/images/user_guide/install_step2.png)
* Confirm that Dungeon Architect is visible and enabled
![Install Step 3](_html/images/user_guide/install_step3.png)
