Introduction
============
Dungeon Architect comes bundled with several examples to quickly get your started.  The samples below use assets that are freely available (e.g. Infinity Blade's Assets) and some are built on other paid assets, which you can readily use if you have them already.


Plugin Installation (Manual)
============================
* If you have purchased the plugin from the Marketplace, install it from the Epic Launcher
* If you have purchased it from the website,  follow these steps:
 - Create a directory named Plugins in your game's root directory
 - Extract the content of the downloaded plugin into the plugins directory. All major versions of UE4 are supported since 4.7. Choose the appropriate one to copy into the Plugins folder 
 - Refer the [User Guide](https://coderespawn.github.io/dungeon-architect-user-guide-ue4) for more info
